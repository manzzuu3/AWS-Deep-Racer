# AWS-Deep-Racer
project involved around the developmenting a reinforcement learning algorithm for a self-driving car in AWS which is a scaled into 1/18th of a full sized car to navigate around race track. where model takes optimal path for the car to complete the circuit and gets best rewards points.

Upon completion of this project, a competition was held within our university, involving 20 other participants, each with different reinforcement learning model strategies. compition involves a penalty of +10 seconds for off-track deviations, my RL model has successful implementation of the algorithm, which secured second place in the competition. Model performed great in complex race tracks.
